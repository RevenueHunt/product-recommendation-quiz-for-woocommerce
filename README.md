Start creating personalized shopping experiences that boost engagement, conversions, and loyalty.

### What You'll Achieve

1. **Boost sales** by guiding customers to their perfect products on the first visit.  
2. **Recover abandoned carts** by sending personalized quiz results straight to their inbox.  
3. **Grow your audience** by capturing and syncing leads with your mailing list or CRM.  
4. **Save time on support** by helping shoppers understand your products before they buy.  
5. **Reduce returns** by helping customers choose the products that truly fit their needs.

### How It Works

Think of it as having a **digital personal shopper** in your WooCommerce store. The quiz asks customers a few tailored questions, analyzes their responses, and recommends the best products — complete with personalized explanations that build trust and increase conversions.

Our top-performing merchants use the quiz as the **first step of their automated sales funnel**. It helps them capture leads, segment their audience, and send targeted campaigns that drive repeat purchases. (Highly segmented campaigns can deliver over [3x more revenue per recipient](https://www.klaviyo.com/marketing-resources/segmentation-benchmark-report "Klaviyo Segmentation Benchmark Report") than unsegmented ones!)
