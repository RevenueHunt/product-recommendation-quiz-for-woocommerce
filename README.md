# Product Recommendation Quiz for WooCommerce

A quiz that does the selling for you. Recover abandoned carts, capture leads and grow your audience.

## Description

Your [Product Recommendation Quiz](https://revenuehunt.com/product-recommendation-quiz-woocommerce/ "Product Recommendation Quiz for WooCommerce") does the selling for you. It's like having **a personal shopper on your WooCommerce store**, guiding your customers from start to cart and helping them find the products that best match their needs.

**Your quiz will help you achieve four goals:**

1. **Boost sales** on the first visit to your store by giving your customers a personalized product recommendation.
2. **Recover abandoned carts**. Quiz results are sent to your customer's inbox so they can come back later and finish the purchase.
3. **Grow your audience**. Captured leads are sent to your mailing list, so you can segment them based on their responses and follow up with targeted campaigns.
4. **Reduce Support costs** by educating your customers about your products (the quiz does the heavy lifting in terms of support and sales for you).

### A PERSONAL SHOPPER FOR YOUR WOOCOMMERCE SHOP

We believe that a personalized interaction with a salesperson is essential for a successful shopping experience. Your customers may not be experts in your products or fully understand which options best suit their needs, and that’s where guidance makes all the difference.

Online shoppers need guidance in finding what they want, just like in real shops.

### HOW OUR PRODUCT RECOMMENDATION QUIZ WORKS

Say goodbye to the outdated "Search Bar" on WooCommerce stores! Our digital personal shopper engages your customers just like a salesperson would, guiding them from start to cart and ensuring they find the products they need.

Our plugin allows the customers to play an active role in the buying experience. The quiz asks your customers a series of questions, analyzes their responses and returns a selection of recommended products that match their needs along with an explanation to why they're the right fit for them.

### CUSTOMIZING THE QUIZ TO YOUR PARTICULAR NEEDS

Just like every customer is unique, we believe every brand has its own personality. Our plugin allows you to customize multiple aspects of the quiz. With our easy-to-use quiz builder you can:

* Define the questions you ask
* Personalize the feedback you give
* Choose within multiple fonts and color palettes
* Choose between multiple display modes (popup, inline or automatic)

### SOME OF OUR KEY FEATURES INCLUDE

* **Plug and play**. Easy to install and configure. No coding required. Sell more effectively within minutes, not weeks.
* **Conditional Logic**. Your customers never have to skip irrelevant questions because with conditional logic rules, they’ll never even see them. This makes the experience easier, with higher completion rates, through a more personal, human interaction.
* **Lead capture**. Incentivize your customers to leave their contact details (for following-up or retargeting).

### WHEN IS A PRODUCT RECOMMENDATION QUIZ USEFUL?

Shops where their customers are overloaded with choices are a great fit, a few cases where our plugin can provide value are:

* The product is complex or it's difficult to compare alternatives
* When buyers do not have clear preferences about what they want
* When people want to make a quick an easy choice (e.g.: gifts)

There are several shopping verticals that are inherently more suited for a Product Recommendation Quiz. These include:

* Skincare, Cosmetics & Beauty
* Nutrition, Vitamins & Supplements
* Clothing, Jewelry & Accessories
* Sports & Outdoor Goods
* Specialized Equipment & Supplies
